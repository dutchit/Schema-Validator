	- front end
	-deploy on npm
	-http://localhost:8000/app/index.html#

ValidateService
	-RESTful back end
	-ValidateService.war deploy on tomcat
	-angularProj calls REST services

To-do:
	-XML output is stripped of white spaces
	-text output has junk characters in place of new line characters
	-additional formatting needed before sending response from back end
	-output is still a string.  Convert to file?
